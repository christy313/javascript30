## Day15 LocalStorage & Event delegation

### Summary

Learn LocalStorage & Event delegation by adding items in a form submit.

### Practice

#### 1. Add event Listener to `form` could both detect enter and click the submit button.

#### 2. Create an `addItem` function to add new items and set items in local storage.

#### 3. Create a `populateList` function to add items to the view.

#### 4. Execute a `populateList` function to make sure the lists exist after refreshing the browser.

#### 5. Toggle done/undone after refreshing.

Using `dataset.index` as an id to control done/undone status.

### Improvement in the future

Add `clearAll`, `checkAll`, and `uncheckAll` buttons to each functionality and reset the local storage.
