#### 1. [flex-direction](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/f/flex-direction/)

#### 2. [Equal Columns With Flexbox: Itâ€™s More Complicated Than You Might Think](https://css-tricks.com/equal-columns-with-flexbox-its-more-complicated-than-you-might-think/)

#### 3. [flex](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/f/flex/)

The flex property is the shorthand for [flex-grow](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/flex-grow), [flex-shrink](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/flex-shrink) and flex-basis.

#### 4. `panel > *` vs `panel *`

A space selector will select all deep descendants.
A greater than selector will only select all immediate descendants.(only next children)
