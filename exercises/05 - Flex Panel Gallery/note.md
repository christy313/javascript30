#### 3. [flex](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/f/flex/)

The flex property is the shorthand for [flex-grow](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/flex-grow), [flex-shrink](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/flex-shrink) and flex-basis.

#### 4. `panel > *` vs `panel *`

A space selector will select all deep descendants.
A greater than selector will only select all immediate descendants.(only next children)
