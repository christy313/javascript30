## Day17 Sort Without Articles

### Summary

Sort an array with band names without defined or undefined articles such as "a", "an" and "the".

```javascript

// input
[
  "The Plot in You",
  "The Devil Wears Prada",
  "Pierce the Veil",
  "A Skylit Drive",
  "Anywhere But Here",
  "An Old Dog",
];
```

```javascript
//output
[
  "Anywhere But Here",
  "The Devil Wears Prada",
  "An Old Dog",
  "Pierce the Veil",
  "The Plot in You",
  "A Skylit Drive",
];
```

### Practice

#### 1. Sort bands in order

#### 2. Remove defined & undefined articles by regular express + `replace()`

#### 3. Make the list as a big string and put the band names to `innerHTML` in the DOM
