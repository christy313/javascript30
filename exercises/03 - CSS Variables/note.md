## Day03 CSS Variables

### Summary

Using CSS custom properties (variables) with JavaScript and updating them in run time.

### Practice

#### 1. Get all input elements, they would be included in a NodeList.

#### 2. Iterate the NodeList with `forEach()` method and put an event listener on them.

#### 3. Write a function `handleUpdate` to `setProperty()` to the input name and value.

#### 4. Listen to the mousemove event too.
